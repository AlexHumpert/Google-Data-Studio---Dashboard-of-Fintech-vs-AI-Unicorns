### Data Source
[Deep Contractor](https://www.kaggle.com/deepcontractor), Associate Data Scientist at CelebalTech and Kaggle Datasets Master posted a [csv file of all current Unicorn Companies in the world](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/unicorn-companies-dataset). The following Google Data Studios dashboard explores differences between fintech and AI unicorns across features such as - number of investors, valuations, years founded and geographical concentration.

### Insights
* Fintech has the highest number of unicorns (205) and AI has the 4th highest (72).
* Despite Fintech having a higher count and total valuation ($blns), AI unicorns has a higher average valuation of 4.31 vs 3.38 $bln.
* USA is leading the race in AI and Fintech unicorns - 148. However, between the two industries, is home overwhelmingly to Fintech unicorns (108 vs 40).
* Investor count is not necessarily correlated to valuation size. High valuations can occur with relatively few investors (lucky investors!!)
